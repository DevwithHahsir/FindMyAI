# Performance Optimizations Applied

## 1. Image Optimization

- Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to developer profile image
- Added explicit width and height to prevent layout shifts
- Created an image optimization script for all images

## 2. JavaScript Optimizations

- Implemented lazy loading for all non-critical components using React.lazy() and Suspense
- Added fallback loading states for better user experience
- Removed unused import (Navbar) from main.jsx
- Updated the build process to split code into smaller chunks

## 3. Font Optimization

- Added `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"` to the font stylesheet
- Added a fallback noscript tag for the font loading
- This prevents render-blocking from Google Fonts

## 4. Build Optimization

- Added terser for advanced JavaScript minification
- Configured chunking strategy to separate vendor code
- Added optimization scripts to package.json
- Updated vite.config.js for better production builds

## 5. Resource Loading

- Added `defer` attribute to the navbar-fix.js script
- Set up manual code splitting for vendor libraries
- Added prefetch and preload hints for critical resources

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run build:optimized` to build the optimized version
2. Test the optimized build locally using `npm run preview`
3. Deploy the optimized version
4. Run Lighthouse again to see the improvements

These changes should significantly improve your Lighthouse score by:

- Reducing JavaScript bundle size
- Eliminating render-blocking resources
- Optimizing image loading
- Improving font loading performance
- Reducing unused JavaScript and CSS

For further improvements, consider implementing:

1. Service Worker for offline caching
2. Responsive image srcsets for different device sizes
3. Self-hosting critical fonts instead of using Google Fonts
