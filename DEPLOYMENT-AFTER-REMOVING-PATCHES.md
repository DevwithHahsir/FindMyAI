# Deployment Steps after removing patch files

After removing the patch files and rebuilding the project, follow these steps to deploy your website:

## 1. Verify that the build completed successfully

Check that the `dist` directory has been updated with the new build files.

## 2. Deploy to Firebase hosting

Run the following command to deploy your application to Firebase hosting:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Hashir Mehboob\Desktop\FindMyAI"
firebase deploy --only hosting:ai-directory
```

## 3. Test the website after deployment

1. Open your website in a browser after deployment
2. Check if the previous errors are resolved
3. Verify that all features are working as expected

## If issues persist

If you still encounter issues after deployment, you may need to:

1. Clear browser caches
2. Check console errors in the browser dev tools
3. Consider other solutions for the original React context error

## Alternative solution if needed

If removing the patch files doesn't resolve the issues, you might want to:

1. Try a different approach to fixing the React context error
2. Consider updating React or related dependencies
3. Check if there are compatibility issues between your dependencies

## Reverting to a known working version

If nothing else works, you can always revert to the last known working version of your website using your version control system or by restoring from a backup.
